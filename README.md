# About the Challenge

## Candidate Considerations

In contrast to my previous challenge, where I used only open-source technologies, this solution leverages a hybrid approach that combines open-source components with scalable, modern cloud technologies. This design is robust and capable of handling up to 100 million requests, with each component optimized for scalability and efficiency.

Notably, the open-source Docker container systems here were tailored specifically to meet the bonus requirements, showcasing a custom design approach that aligns with the projectâ€™s goals.

Detailed architectural discussions and setup instructions can be found in their respective README files within the project.
